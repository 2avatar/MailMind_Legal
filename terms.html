<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
<p class="updated">Last updated: February 21, 2026</p>

<p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the MailMind application ("Service") operated by MailMind ("we", "us", "our"). By creating an account or using the Service, you agree to these Terms.</p>

<h2>1. Description of Service</h2>
<p>MailMind is an AI-powered email management tool that connects to your Gmail account via Google OAuth. It allows you to organize, label, archive, draft, send, and manage emails using natural language commands processed by artificial intelligence.</p>

  <li>You must have a valid Google account with Gmail.</li>
  <li>You must have the authority to grant MailMind access to the Gmail account you connect.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Your Account</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and session.</li>
  <li>You must not share your session credentials with others.</li>
  <li>You must notify us immediately if you believe your account has been compromised.</li>
  <li>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Acceptable Use</h2>
<p>You agree NOT to use MailMind to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Send spam, phishing, or unsolicited bulk emails.</li>
  <li>Impersonate another person or entity.</li>
  <li>Violate any applicable law or regulation (including CAN-SPAM, GDPR, and CCPA).</li>
  <li>Attempt to circumvent rate limits, security controls, or access controls.</li>
  <li>Use auto-pilot rules to mass-modify emails in a way that could harm others (e.g., auto-deleting emails from legal proceedings).</li>
  <li>Reverse-engineer, decompile, or attempt to extract the source code of the Service.</li>
  <li>Use the Service to train AI models or for data mining purposes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. AI-Powered Features</h2>

<div class="highlight">
  <strong>Important:</strong> MailMind uses Anthropic's Claude AI to process your commands. Email content (metadata and body excerpts) is sent to Anthropic for processing. See our <a href="/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for full details.
</div>

<ul>
  <li><strong>AI is not infallible.</strong> The AI may misinterpret commands, miscategorize emails, or take unintended actions. Always review proposals before confirming bulk operations.</li>
  <li><strong>Preview before execute.</strong> For destructive or bulk actions, MailMind shows a preview and requires your explicit confirmation before executing.</li>
  <li><strong>Auto-pilot rules.</strong> Rules you create run automatically every 15 minutes. You are responsible for the rules you create and their effects on your email.</li>
  <li><strong>Undo.</strong> Many actions can be undone, but some (like sending emails or permanent deletion by Gmail) cannot be reversed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Unsubscribe Feature</h2>
<ul>
  <li>MailMind may send unsubscribe requests on your behalf using the List-Unsubscribe header mechanism.</li>
  <li>For unsubscribe methods that require sending an email from your account, MailMind will show you the exact email content before sending.</li>
  <li>We are not responsible for how third-party senders handle your unsubscribe request.</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Subscriptions &amp; Billing</h2>

  <li>Payments are processed securely by Stripe. We do not store your payment card details.</li>
